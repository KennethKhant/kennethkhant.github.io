          <p className="text-zinc-200">
            My focus is on electronics, robotics, and embedded systems, but I also enjoy diving into software projects and experimenting with new tech. 
            Whether it‚Äôs CAD design, PCB layout, or coding in C/C++, I love bringing ideas to life. 
            When I‚Äôm not in the lab or soldering a circuit you‚Äôll probably find me
            hiking arund SD,reading about psychology, listening music or dialing in coffee/tea.

           <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">My Journey</h2>
            <p className="text-zinc-200">
              Since I was young, I‚Äôve been fascinated by electronics and circuit boards. I still remember
              the first time I opened up a broken RC car my dad bought for me. I didn‚Äôt know what a PCB
              was back then, but when I saw that green board with wires and components, I was curious.
              My dad helped me fix it by soldering a loose wire, and that moment sparked my interest in
              how things work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-200">
              Later in high school, one of my favorite physics professors introduced me to series and
              parallel connections with batteries and LEDs. I started experimenting on my own, and the
              joy I felt <span className="font-semibold">when the LED lit up</span> confirmed my determination to pursue
              electrical engineering as a career.

      <div className="w-full md:w-[70%] space-y-4 max-w-prose">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">What Motivate Me?</h2>
          <p className="text-zinc-200">
            For me, engineering is about more than just making things work. It‚Äôs about
            building systems that people can actually use, tools that make life easier,
            safer, or more exciting. I‚Äôm motivated by the challenge of taking an idea
            that only exists on paper and transforming it into a real, working system
            that can be held, tested, and trusted in the field.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-200">
            I find energy in problem-solving whether that‚Äôs debugging a stubborn circuit,
            redesigning a PCB that didn‚Äôt fit the first time, or optimizing code until it
            runs just right. Those small wins remind me why I chose this path. The moment
            when something I built powers on for the first time is what keeps me moving
            forward.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-200">
            At the core, what drives me most is impact. I want my projects to do more
            than just prove a concept they should help people, spark curiosity, or
            inspire others to create. Knowing that my work might make someone else‚Äôs
            problem a little easier to solve gives me the motivation to keep building,
            learning, and pushing boundaries.
